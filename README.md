There are two forms; digital and tangible. Owners of the art will receipt both.

1. Digital as a NFT transferable between wallet, initially via the Ethereum Smart Contract
2. Tangible form painted on a canva, which will be ship to a local arts gallery where owners can pickup once completed. The tangible art aren't available right away as need to be worked... it may takes months or years.
   Owners will be contacted once the art work is done.

The reason for the two forms are from my own perspective of what art is. Each art take time, effort, and creativity, so arts are rare piece of works to be admired by many, but limited to only a few.
